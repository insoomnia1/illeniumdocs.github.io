fivem-appearance comes with 2 themes, `default` and `qb-core` and `qb-core` is set as the default one.

!!!important
    After creating the custom theme, make sure to change `currentTheme` to the `id` of the new theme. You can ofcourse modify the existing themes as well if you want, but it is recommended to create your own so that you can switch between the defaults and the custom one whenever needed.
